# Code of Conduct

## 1. Purpose

A primary goal of Vault is to be inclusive to the largest number of contributors, with the most varied and diverse backgrounds possible. As such, we are committed to providing a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for all, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, ability, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and religion (or lack thereof).

This code of conduct outlines our expectations for all those who participate in our community, as well as the consequences for unacceptable behavior.

## 2. Open Source Citizenship

A supplemental goal of this Code of Conduct is to increase open source citizenship by encouraging participants to recognize and strengthen the relationships between our actions and their effects on our community.

Communities mirror the societies in which they exist and positive action is essential to counteract the many forms of inequality and abuses of power that exist in society.

## 3. Expected Behavior

The following behaviors are expected and requested of all community members:

* Participate in an authentic and active way. In doing so, you contribute to the health and longevity of this community.
* Exercise consideration and respect in your speech and actions.
* Attempt collaboration before conflict.
* Refrain from demeaning, discriminatory, or harassing behavior and speech.
* Be mindful of your surroundings and of your fellow participants.

## 4. Unacceptable Behavior

The following behaviors are considered harassment and are unacceptable within our community:

* Violence, threats of violence or violent language directed against another person.
* Sexist, racist, homophobic, transphobic, ableist or otherwise discriminatory jokes and language.
* Posting or displaying sexually explicit or violent material.
* Personal insults, particularly those related to gender, sexual orientation, race, religion, or disability.
* Inappropriate photography or recording.
* Deliberate intimidation, stalking or following (online or in person).
* Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behavior.

## 5. Consequences of Unacceptable Behavior

Unacceptable behavior from any community member, including sponsors and those with decision-making authority, will not be tolerated. Anyone asked to stop unacceptable behavior is expected to comply immediately.

If a community member engages in unacceptable behavior, the community organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, up to and including a temporary ban or permanent expulsion from the community without warning.

## 6. Reporting Guidelines

If you are subject to or witness unacceptable behavior, or have any other concerns, please notify a community organizer as soon as possible.

## 7. Addressing Grievances

Only permanent resolutions (such as bans) may be reversed by the Vault project maintainers.

## 8. Contact Info

If you need to report an issue, contact one of the maintainers.

## 9. License and Attribution
